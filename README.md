# Language-Detection-Model

The Language Detection Model is a machine learning-based approach that accurately detects the language of a given text. It can identify 17 different languages, including English, Malayalam, Hindi, Tamil, Portuguese, French, Dutch, Spanish, Greek, Russian, Danish, Italian, Turkish, Swedish, Arabic, German, and Kannada. The model utilizes the MultinomialNB algorithm and achieves an impressive accuracy of 98%. Streamlit is used for user-friendly UI experience.

## Installation
